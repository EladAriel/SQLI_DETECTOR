# Live Demo Checklist - Final Preparation

## ✅ Pre-Demo System Check (15 minutes before demo)

### Infrastructure Verification
- [ ] PostgreSQL container running: `docker ps | grep postgres`
- [ ] Database accessible: `npm run task:postgres:check`
- [ ] Environment variables set: Check `.env` file exists
- [ ] Ports available: 3001, 3002, 5432

### Service Startup Sequence
- [ ] **Step 1**: Start PostgreSQL: `npm run task:postgres:start`
- [ ] **Step 2**: Verify DB: `npm run task:postgres:check`
- [ ] **Step 3**: Start Static API: `npm run api:start` (Terminal 1)
- [ ] **Step 4**: Start RAG Service: `npm run rag:start` (Terminal 2)
- [ ] **Step 5**: Start MCP Server: `npm run mcp:start` (Terminal 3)

### Health Verification
- [ ] Static API health: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
- [ ] RAG Service health: `curl http://localhost:3002/health`
- [ ] MCP Server logs show: "SQL Injection MCP Server started successfully"
- [ ] Orchestrator initialized: "MCP Analysis Orchestrator initialized"

## 🎯 Demo Execution Plan

### Opening (2 minutes)
- [ ] Show architecture diagram from README.md
- [ ] Explain intelligent orchestration concept
- [ ] Highlight two-tier analysis strategy

### Round 1: Fast Static Analysis (2 minutes)
```bash
# Test query - should route to static only
echo "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1 OR 1=1'" | mcp analyze_sql_query
```
**Expected**: <100ms response, pattern detection

### Round 2: AI-Enhanced Analysis (3 minutes)  
```bash
# Complex obfuscated query - should route to static + AI
echo "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = CONCAT('admin', CHAR(39), ' OR ', CHAR(39), '1')" | mcp analyze_sql_query
```
**Expected**: <3s response, detailed AI analysis

### Round 3: File Upload Demo (2 minutes)
- [ ] Upload vulnerable PHP file
- [ ] Show comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Demonstrate secure code suggestions

### Round 4: Batch Processing (1 minute)
- [ ] Submit mixed complexity queries
- [ ] Show intelligent routing per query
- [ ] Highlight performance optimization

## 🛡️ Backup Strategies

### If MCP Server Fails
- [ ] Direct API calls ready:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/analyze \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '\''1 OR 1=1'\''"}'
  ```

### If Services Don't Start
- [ ] Screenshots of expected outputs ready
- [ ] Architecture slides prepared
- [ ] Manual demonstration of concepts

### Emergency Demo Data
```sql
-- Safe for static demo
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1 OR 1=1'

-- Complex for AI demo  
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = (SELECT CASE WHEN (ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT user()),1,1))=114) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
```

## 📊 Success Metrics to Highlight
