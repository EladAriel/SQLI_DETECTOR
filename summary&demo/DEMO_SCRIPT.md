## 📋 Demo Script - Intelligent Routing in Action

### Scenario 1: Fast Static Analysis (<100ms)
**Purpose**: Demonstrate Tier 1 - Fast pattern-based detection

#### Sample Query 1: Simple SQL Injection
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1 OR 1=1 --'
```

**MCP Tool**: `analyze_sql_query`
**Expected Route**: Static Analysis Only
**Expected Response Time**: <100ms
**Demonstration Points**:
- Immediate pattern recognition
- Known injection signature detection
- Fast response without AI overhead

#### Sample Query 2: Union-Based Attack
```sql
SELECT name FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT password FROM users
```

**Expected Route**: Static Analysis Only
**Expected Response Time**: <100ms
**Demonstration Points**:
- UNION injection pattern detection
- Risk scoring (HIGH severity)
- Immediate response with remediation

### Scenario 2: AI-Enhanced Deep Analysis (<3s)
**Purpose**: Demonstrate Tier 2 - Complex analysis with contextual AI

#### Sample Query 3: Obfuscated Complex Injection
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = CONCAT('admin', CHAR(39), ' OR ', CHAR(39), '1', CHAR(39), '=', CHAR(39), '1')
```

**MCP Tool**: `analyze_sql_query`
**Expected Route**: Static + AI Enhancement
**Expected Response Time**: <3s
**Demonstration Points**:
- Static analysis identifies suspicious patterns
- AI enhancement provides detailed obfuscation analysis
- Contextual explanation of CHAR() obfuscation technique

#### Sample Query 4: Time-Based Blind Injection
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = 1 AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = database() AND SLEEP(5)) = 0
```

**Expected Route**: Static + AI Enhancement
**Expected Response Time**: <3s
**Demonstration Points**:
- Complex time-based attack detection
- AI provides detailed explanation of blind injection techniques
- Comprehensive remediation strategy

### Scenario 3: File Upload Analysis
**Purpose**: Demonstrate intelligent file processing

#### Sample PHP File: Vulnerable Login Script
```php
<?php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $username . "' AND password = '" . $password . "'";
$result = mysql_query($query);

if (mysql_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    echo "Login successful!";
} else {
    echo "Invalid credentials!";
}
?>
```

**MCP Tool**: `upload_and_analyze_file`
**Expected Route**: Static + AI Enhancement (due to file size and complexity)
**Expected Response Time**: <3s
**Demonstration Points**:
- File parsing and context analysis
- Multiple vulnerability detection (SQL injection + deprecated functions)
- Secure code alternatives provided
- Best practices recommendations

### Scenario 4: Batch Processing Intelligence
**Purpose**: Demonstrate smart batching with mixed complexity

#### Mixed Query Batch
```json
{
  "queries": [
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1",  // Safe - Static only
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1 OR 1=1'",  // Simple injection - Static only  
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = (SELECT CASE WHEN (ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT user()),1,1))=114) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)"  // Complex - Static + AI
  ]
}
```

**MCP Tool**: `batch_analyze_queries`
**Expected Routing**:
- Query 1: Static only (<100ms)
- Query 2: Static only (<100ms) 
- Query 3: Static + AI (<3s)
**Total Time**: <3.2s for 3 queries
**Demonstration Points**:
- Intelligent per-query routing
- Performance optimization through smart analysis selection
- Detailed vulnerability report with varying analysis depth

```sql
-- Simple injection (always works)
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '1 OR 1=1'

-- Classic UNION attack  
SELECT name FROM products WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT password FROM users

-- Safe query for comparison
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?
```
